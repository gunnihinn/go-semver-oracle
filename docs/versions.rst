Version names
=============

We will not follow semantic versioning, because it is a lie. We agree with Rich
Hickey that the only thing users care about is whether or not updating our
software breaks theirs, and that a good way to signal that is by a name change.

As we don't know how many such releases we will go through, we need a source
that will not run out of names. We have thus chosen to name each release after a
victim of a US drone strike. We gather some here:

- Mamana Bibi
- Irfan Wazir
- Zaman Wazir
- Gul Dad Khan
- Kashmir Khan
- Wolayet Khan
- Saleh Khan
- Shamroz Khan
- Fazel Rehman
- Wali Ullah
- Sahibdin
- Mir Ajab Khan
- Min Gul
- Bangal Khan
- Dil Gir Khan
- Sahid Din
- Mir Ajat
- Haq Nawaz
- Hatiqullah
- Akram
- Shoaib
